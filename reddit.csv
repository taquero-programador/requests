Python,AlSweigart,"Humre: a Python module for creating human-readable regular expressions. I just finished the initial version. I thought it would take a day, but actually took me two weeks. Wha-whomp.

https://pypi.org/project/Humre/

Need a regex for matching hexadecimal numbers that optionally have a `0x` or `0X` prefix and must be lowercase or uppercase but not both? Here's the not-so-easy-to-read-or-even-write regex:

    import re
    re.compile('(?:(?:0x|0X)[0-9a-f]+)|(?:(?:0x|0X)[0-9A-F]+)|(?:[0-9a-f]+)|(?:[0-9A-F]+)')

With Humre, it's a bit longer but much easier to read and debug:

    from humre import *
    compile(
        either(
            noncap_group(noncap_group(either('0x', '0X')), one_or_more(chars('0-9a-f'))),
            noncap_group(noncap_group(either('0x', '0X')), one_or_more(chars('0-9A-F'))),
            noncap_group(one_or_more(chars('0-9a-f'))),
            noncap_group(one_or_more(chars('0-9A-F')))
        )
    )

Code is read more often than it is written, so having longer but easier to understand code is worth it. Since the regex is written as Python code instead of in an unstructured string, your IDE can also help you with it:

* Your editor's parentheses matching works.
* Your editor's syntax highlight works.
* Your editor's linter and type hints tool picks up typos.
* Your editor's autocomplete works.
* Auto-formatter tools like Black can automatically format your regex code.
* Humre handles raw strings/string escaping for you.
* You can put actual Python comments alongside your Humre code.
* Better error messages for invalid regexes",5,Sunday Daily Thread: What's everyone working on this week?

Python,extra_pickles,"Working in IoT w/ a dockerized microservices architecture that is mainly Python that is now looking to scale the 'non-software' bits of the business.

Basically building the one stop data shop to better facilitate interaction, investigation, manipulation, exploration, model training, predictive fault monitoring & visualization.

It'll be a stand alone orchestration of a VM that handles a series of tools aimed to assist scientists & data scientists to derive increased value from the data we already have. One Click access to it all - abstract away the config, the installs, anything that slows them down.

The weight of it all is being able to genericize the offerings so that they can continue to grow as our offerings grow - covering raw sensor data, downsampling, shaping, time series data, relational models, generation & storage and delivery.  Basically allow interaction with any point in the data lifecycle in any desired format.

From a business standpoint it will be able to generate databases and orchestrate PowerBI/Or similar connections to ""auto-magically"" allow power users to create visualisation of databases they just created via our various tools and wizards. And code free integrate alerts and notifications with Slack/Teams.

After a google dive, it clicked that the cli tool worked because I was calling the main script directly. Doing that added the package location into the sys.path implicitly.

    import sys

Python,OuiOuiKiwi,">What is considered “best practice”. For example, should you use classes & OOP, or is that considered more of an anti pattern in lieu of more functional styles?

There are no strict rules about it, use what best fits your goals.

If you want to write a short automation script to sort your pictures, no need to go all OOP with it.

Avoid falling into cargo cults where things are used, even when they don't fit, for... reasons.",23,"Is there consensus for when/where to use certain practices, such as OOP vs functions & modules?"
Python,bigdatabro,"Regarding OOP vs Functional Programming, there's a great volume of discussion about when to use both.

Generally speaking, the [Expression Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem) is a problem in programming language design about what language paradigms, like OOP or FP, best model different problems. Since this problem was introduced, programmers have noticed two principles: **object-oriented programming** works well when you have many **things** with the same **behaviors**, while **functional programming** excels when you have a few **things** with many different **behaviors**. It's easy to see why; adding a new thing in OOP is as simple as creating a subclass or implementing an interface, and adding a behavior in FP is simple as adding a function to a type class.

We see this principle in how different languages fit different domains. Programs like GUI applications or 3D video games have lots of things with similar behaviors, so OOP works great for these. So, OOP languages like Java and C# are popular for these domains. On the other hand, data processing and financial trading have simple data points and tables with complex, ever-changing transformations and algorithms. So, FP languages like Scala and Haskell have become popular in these domains.

For Python, you have the flexibility of deciding which paradigm meets your problem. Python data processing libraries are mostly functional; even though they use classes for things like arrays and dataframes, functions and modules perform most of the heavy lifting, and decorators and higher-order functions are very common. The Airflow library even uses monads for chaining functions together into DAGs. For GUI design, Python libraries are pretty object-based with inheritance and class composition.

If in doubt, a few principles can help:

- Both OOP and FP libraries utilize classes, at least barebones classes just to model data types.
- FP design usually means fewer lines of code for the user, especially with smart decorator use.
- Many libraries give two methods for the same tasks with different paradigms. MatPlotLib is like this, where the docs will show how to create visualizations using the two different strategies.
- Complex design patterns from Java/C# don't always work well in Python OOP. Function decorators are much more ""Pythonic"" than adapter classes, and Singletons aren't possible without hacky workarounds for private methods.",20,"Is there consensus for when/where to use certain practices, such as OOP vs functions & modules?"

2. Niggle 2. Functional does not mean functions. Functional means (very simply) that we never mutate state of inputs to our functions. This means the method on an object could be functional as long as we never mutate the state of our object. 

3. I’m going to say functional is used heavily when implement pure mathematical algorithms because the papers don’t get written with state mutation in mind. However once you get into more complex systems mutating state may be more readable.

I think this is the key: you should use the style that makes the most readable and concise code. Don’t ever feel you NEED to coerce your code into one style because convention…. The convention should be to write clean and readable code .",5,"Is there consensus for when/where to use certain practices, such as OOP vs functions & modules?"

So for example, you could create a FileName class that takes a complete filename  (directorypath/basename.ext) as its argument. You could then create properties that break down the filename into its component parts for easier access to that information.

Now of course you could call functions from the standard library to perform these functions and in fact that will be what your class does.

- i like what I see. Let me see it for another result
- i still like what i see, now I’ll make it into a function
- ill repeatedly use this function until i find it’s a small tool for something larger

It usually ends there as functions are generally enough for data handling, but if you really want to make an interactive tool, using classes and OOP is the way to go imo. You’d be able to take advantage of attribute storage and calling, inheritance, and much more.

Python,spinwizard69,"It starts with knowing when to use Python in the first place!   This is really key as we now have Python as an embedded language for Microprocessors but this concept is general enough for mainstream Python.  Sometimes Python is the wrong choice.  

Now when you are within Python the same concept applies to what you make use of with Python.  Several people have already posted about this but programs need to be no more complex than is required.   The term we got taught is “idiomatic” which often seems to be disregarded these days.  As an aside there seems to be a drive to make Python more complex and convoluted these days, that is a huge mistake in my mind.   One of Pythons great strengths is readability; something both users and language designers should strive for.  

Learn each part of the core language well, inside out if you will.  This especially as new pathways open up. String formatting is one example here.  The idea is to avoid reinventing the wheel because you don’t understand what Python already offers.  If you are using something new such as math, in your code, read the docs so you don’t reinvent a variable or function already available!

Possibly the most important thing I can offer up is this: if you start writing convoluted code, for better performance, you need to consider that you are using the wrong language. The whole reason to use Python in my mind is for the ability to do quick development while maintaining readable code.  That is code that ANYBODY can understand even a non programmer.  To me this is huge and the whole reason for Pythons existence,  otherwise one could use BASH to write throw away code.

Python,Hadr1ck,"A lot of efficiency using python actual comes before you write a single line of python (or any other language for that matter). Splitting a problem into smaller sub problems (recursively as appropriate) increases the chances you will see an easy way to solve that small sub problem — most likely using an external library. 

I would say this tackles both developer efficiency and runtime efficiency — a mature external library will have been looked at by thousands of people who have had the opportunity to squeeze every last ml of efficiency out of it. Or, they actually wrote it in C(++) so it’s pretty fast anyway (numpy, etc). 

Lastly, I want to put in something I don’t think people do enough of : look at how an external library does things , especially their directory structure, project layout, documentation, comments, docstrings, use of linters and formatters, code structure.

All throughout highschool me and my family had always envisioned me going into Civil or Industrial Engineering.

  


At the tail end of highschool I stumbled on a website for a tutorial on how to 'program' a calculator in visual basic (lol)

  


I got so into it and was very proud of some shoddy calculator I made that could only do basic arithmetics that when I was applying for uni, I silently inserted a BE Software course above the BE Civil in my applications and surprisingly got it.

  


It was a bit of a challenge at first since my cohort consisted of maybe 40% who had formal education on programming prior to university (either they were already working and needed qualifications to further their career OR they were taught in high school), so I had to work my butt off playing 'catch up' even though it was an intro to programming course lol.

Python,JayDeeEss,Unlikely. Python is an interpreted language not a compiled language. Until Python can be compiled it won't be able to operate as quickly as compiled code.,10,Can python be faster than c++ in future? Any chance!
Python,Hadr1ck,"Interpreted languages will likely never be as quick as compiled languages. Optimising compilers recognise and optimise so many common patterns than an interpreted language won’t be able to do. Once python has compiled into byte code (after the first run*) it will run a little quicker, but you’re still looking at ~2 orders of magnitude slower than C, C++, Fortran etc. 

Your options: 
1. Use libraries written in C/C++ that are already pretty fast (numpy for example). 

2. Compiling python with cython and making no optimisations will about double the speed with 0 effort. You make optimisations, you can get very close to C speed.

3. Numba is a really great library that makes optimising well written python code easy. Again, you might have to refactor some code to get maximum performance. I prefer numba over cython because you are writing pure python, and not some weird child of C and Python, that can still be just as fast. It had great numpy support.

4. Don’t use python. Our robotics department uses Julia a lot. I can’t say I know anything about robotics using Julia but I can say Julia is a great language that is fast, has great support for maths and scientific computing, and is really lovely to write. It is also higher level than C and more on the level of Python. 

Hope this helps :)",6,Can python be faster than c++ in future? Any chance!
Python,teerre,"Considering that Python being faster than the C++ does not, in fact, go against any of the fundamental laws of our universe, I can confidently tell you that yes, it's within the helm of possibility that in some future Python will be faster than C++",3,Can python be faster than c++ in future? Any chance!
Python,sudo_robot_destroy,"I've used C++ and Python for robotics for years. The two compliment each other well. Python is great at higher level logic and C++ is great for low level things.

Personally, unless there is a dependency or system reason, I tend to always start a prototype in Python and get to the point where the system works end to end for simplified, quick datasets and I don't worry about speed until I get to that point. I prefer python for this because it's easier for me to transfer my thoughts to python rather than C++. I'm able to slap the system together quickly and focus on the task at hand rather than putting so much thought into programming.

Then I'll look at what parts need to be optimized. The old saying ""just enough is always enough"" is important here. If a function works and it's faster than your targeted control loop, it's done, no need to optimize further. It's easy to lose a few days optimizing something that was fine to start with. Understanding the importance of this is what separates productive engineers from ... others idk lol I don't want to insult anyone's profession. Sometimes you'll be surprised what python is capable of doing ""fast enough"". In those cases, it doesn't matter that C++ could do it faster (because we're engineers, not those other professions)

If something does need optimized there are a few options. The first is make sure you didn't do something stupid in you're python code. If not, ask if sprinkling in a little numba would speed things up. I recommend learning numba at least a little to become familiar with use cases for it because sometimes it is as simple as adding a decorator to your python function. I've seen numba run faster than C++ in some situations. And it makes parallel processing a breeze... even on GPUs, it's blazing fast.

Finally, if numba doesn't save the day, I'll rewrite parts in C++ and run that in a separate ROS node if I'm using ROS or make a DLL or shared library if not and call that from python. I find that having the python prototype makes writing C++ easier, so I don't really care about having to do the typing twice. During this process, I'm really just focusing on the programming because the task at hand is already solved.

All that being said, some advanced python libraries are coming along that are really exciting. For example Symforce, which lets you write your problem at a very high level using symbolic math, and it will generate super optimized C++ code for you. C++ is the new assembly! Maybe not quite yet, but I think it's an indicator for where the future is heading.",2,Can python be faster than c++ in future? Any chance!
Python,mprz,Rotfl,2,Can python be faster than c++ in future? Any chance!
Python,Barn07,"No, Python can conceptually not be faster than C++. One of the goals of C++ is to leave as little space between between Assembly and C++, i.e. C++ gives you a high level language that's almost as close to the hardware as feasible. Thus, C++ may produce the fastest programs possible, if you discount C, which is arguably a tad bit faster since it does not mangle function names and jazz like that. Python does not have that that claim to be close to Assembly or the hardware. Thus, even a hypothetical compiled Version of Python may generally only as fast as C++, though implementation matters, e.g. choice of algorithm.

However, I work in robotics and our software runs in Python in a mix of C/C++ at 50 Hz which is enough to nicely deal with collaborative robots, e.g. Kuka, Fanuc, Universal Robots.",1,Can python be faster than c++ in future? Any chance!

Python,Stringscunningham,I switched from Spyder to VSC. VSC is way better for writing actually programs. I also found it is easier for me to turn my scripts into programs. I like the VSC Jupyter notebook because I can write a script and don’t have to have it is as an actual Jupyter notebook. I am not a fan of Jupyter notebook layout when trying to create a data analysis routine since I tend to add and remove steps as I am developing a program as well as modifying what I am importing which I find easier to do in a script. I find only using Jupyter notebooks to be slow for that kind of stuff. I found VSC to be more flexible than Spyder and git is integrated a lot better than in Spyder. Also people were having issues with Kite in Spyder because it is basically malware and it seemed like Spyder either did not remove Kite or took a long time to remove it. Lastly there is an open source version of VSC called VSCodium that supposably does not send the telemetry and other data to Microsoft (if you care about that stuff).

One thing I do miss about Spyder is how you can open an array or matrix in the variable explorer and see a spreadsheet type display of the data. That is pretty slick, I wonder if there is a VCS plugin for that...

As a cloud engineer I use a lot of python. Specially where powershell is just too slow, like large projects.

The good thing about python is that is versatile enough to be used on most clouds (I know that the aws team uses it a lot)",17,Should you study python for a career in cloud computing?
Python,routetehpacketz,"You can write an app and host it in the cloud.

You can use Python to interact with APIs running in the cloud.",7,Should you study python for a career in cloud computing?
Python,BIPThatInstance,"Yes, but learn cloud first, since asking for what types of projects you could create would be explained once you dive into cloud computing and a provider-specific terminology, services, and learn how they fit together.

You can do just about anything with Python. Re-host your projects on the cloud, build infrastructure with code, write automation scripts for Ops/Security use cases, build ML pipelines or big data projects -- literally endless. Anything you can build in the console, any type of app you can think of, you can 95% do it with Python.

I'm a CISO right now and still write a ton of Python day-to-day, and have been as an engineer, PM, Director, etc. I'll repeat myself though - you should learn one specific cloud and begin with the ""sales"" info (what is this service for, who uses it), practice in the console with self-paced or blog learning, and then get into using a Python SDK or you'll burn yourself out and not actually learn anything.",7,Should you study python for a career in cloud computing?

You either go into DevOps where you work with specific clouds to manage deployments and working applications etc or you go with development itself where you make web apps or other services that work on cloud platforms.

Python,supra621,"Which side of the cloud? Cloud provider? or cloud customer?

Cloud providers (Google, Azure, AWS, etc.) can use a variety of languages to run their infrastructure. From my experience in the business, and in no particular order: Go, Java, Python, Ruby, Scala, and Typescript, depending on the domain.

The cloud is mostly bunch of Linux machines running VMs and containers, plus some level of proprietary management and interface depending on the provider. In general though, if you can write and run it on a physical Linux machine, it can probably run on someone else’s Linux machine in the cloud. If you’re looking at building services in the cloud for other people or businesses to use, Python is a versatile language to know.

The infrastructure and automation that make the cloud work are, also, mostly a bunch of Linux machines running VMs and containers. Knowing any modern object-oriented language will tick at least one of the boxes on a job application. I see less of what I would call “core infrastructure” built in Python, though. Compiled languages with static typing tend to win over the preference of developers for those systems. Python still finds numerous uses beyond that, particularly for high-level automation, web frameworks, and data wrangling. Once again, some of its strength is its versatility.

Full disclosure I work in the cloud, with the cloud, and for the cloud.  

All the major CSPs (AWS, GCP, Azure) benefit from Python, primarily as a language for administrative scripting and as the lingua franca for data science and EDA.  

It's also great for quick CLIs and for building clear and concise demonstrations with easy to read code.

Python,VoidStar16,"Nice job! Here are some things I would look at if you're interested in refactoring.

Python3.6 and above comes with type annotations. These are very helpful in a dynamically typed language because as the application grows or other people work on it, it's more clear what the purpose of variables are from a type perspective. Note that the annotations arent enforced by the compiler but the labels help, and python has packages like mypy that is able to enforce typing if youre interested. I always at least use annotations even on small projects.

Typically, global variables are a no-no. If you choose to use them, put them at the top of the program under imports, and if they are supposed to be readonly, use uppercase for the naming. An alternative to globals might be a class with static variables or maybe getters / setters (properties).

I don't prefer to return a tuple of lists like the posts, titles and posts, links returns you have. I think a better way would be to use a data structure like a class to organize all those variables. This may be more of a stylistic thing but typically in OOP you would want those in classes. I could go on about how all the functions could be wrapped up in classes too but it may not be necessary for what you're trying to accomplish (that being said, posts, links, and titles could make for good member variables ;))

The error message ""An error occurred"" is not very descriptive. If I ran this program and saw that error, I wouldnt know exactly what happened, which would be a shame because I like mechanical keyboards and instead of getting the Hunter emails Id have to read the code :(  /s I like reading code though but you have control over that error message so why not make it more specific then.

I would also get rid of the tests because they are not actually unit or coverage tests but rather just a testing script. Also the learning files because I dont think thats related to the main app either. I could be wrong though I just took a quick look and Im typing on mobile.

On that note I forgot if you have this but Python programs usually have an if __name__ == '__main__' entrypoint at the bottom of the script that includes the code required to start the program. It's not needed but a strongly held convention similar to other langauges like java and c with a ""main"" function.

One more thing - I dont care for the input() call in the send email function. That's too many side effects for me and it makes that part of the code unmockable if you ever decide to grow the project and add unit tests. Take a look at IoC (inversion of control) for how to inject these inputs, or else an easier way would be to provide user/password from a config file. If you're worried about security, you could encrypt the file and decrypt it in the app and then pass them as args to that function. That solution would also help to automate your project!

Maybe a try/catch around that smtp.send function to - most I/O should have error handling.

Anyways, hopefully that helps and you can learn something from what I said. Cheers and happy coding, keep it up 🐍",1,A personal project from a bootcamp graduate

Python,ACuriousBidet,"Pardon the cliche, but programming is like baking a cake .. or more specifically, the recipe for baking a cake

Step 1 gather ingredients

Step 2 combine eggs, butter, flour, milk

Step 3 preheat oven

Step 4 bake

Etc.


Congrats you've just run the ""bake a cake"" program!

You can think of a computer program as a recipe for machines

Ingredients go in, the recipe transforms the ingredients, cake comes out

Some data goes in, the program transforms the data, some new data comes out

When writing a program, you begin by storing your data into ""variables"", where a variable is like the X in Y =mX + b from math class

However unlike math class, in programming your variables can be more than numbers. There are different ""types"" of data.

When learning a language, it's best to start by learning the ""primitive types"":

Int(eger) is numbers

String is text

Bool(ean) is true / false


There are some others, but these are the basics. For now we'll focus on integer.

You start your cake recipe by gathering your ingredients 

You start your program by assigning data to variables 

Variable assignment goes like this:

    egg = 1
    butter = 2
    flour = 3
    milk = 4


A single ""equal sign"" performs variable assignment 

Egg holds the value of the number 1

`Egg + 1` is equal to 2

now let's assign cake

`cake = egg + butter + flour + milk`

What value does cake hold?

Let's make a recipe function to find out!

A ""function"" is a way to package up some code so you can easily reuse it again and again

If an egg is data, then something like an oven is a function: a reusable tool that does something to the data 

And as programmers, it would be nice if instead of saying Egg + ... + milk everytime you want a cake, you could just say bake_cake()

    def bake_cake():
        egg = 1
        butter = 2
        flour = 3
        milk = 4
        return egg + butter + flour + milk

    cake = bake_cake()
    print(cake)


Let me pause to explain the above syntax

""def"" is a keyword that tells python you are defining a function

The parentheses are used to pass parameters (input data) to a function. Right now they're empty, no input data

The "":"" and indented lines indicate the function ""scope"", which is a term that refers to the code that belongs to the function. Ex ""cake = bake_cake()"" does not belong to the function, because it is not indented

""return"" is a keyword that means ""end of function, return this value""

Remember, data goes in, new data comes out

New data is coming out of the function

We capture that data by saying:

`cake = bake_cake()`

In literal terms, the ""cake"" variable is being assigned the value returned by the ""bake_cake"" function

`print(cake)`

""Print"" is a built in python function that Let's you see what value a variable is holding 

OK let's recap: we've covered primitive types, variable assignment, some basic arithmetic, and functions 

And CAKE! Sweet sweet cake!

But here's the thing, a computer program is way more powerful than a cooking recipe

Let's say instead of a function that just bakes a cake, we could have a function that cooks whatever ""list"" of ingredients we give it. That's a lot better right?

In python, we define a list like this

`nums = [10, 20, 30]`

The variable ""nums"" is assigned a list of 3 numbers

A list is an example of an ""object"", a more advanced data type compared to the primitive types we learned earlier 

Lists have special operators that let you add, fetch, update, and remove data 

For example you can fetch the data as follows:

    ten = nums[0]
    twenty = nums[1]
    thirty = nums[2]

The numbers between the brackets are called ""indexes""

You can think of the index as the position of a value in the list, starting with 0 for the left-most position 

OK now back to cake!

I said we want a list of ingredients, so let's do that

`ingredients = [egg, butter, flour, milk]`

Great, so I've shown you how to store values and fetch values in a list, which frankly isn't much help to us .. yet!

What would make it helpful is if python had a special tool that let's you step through a list one by one, and for each element do something with it

Oh wait python does have such a tool? Tell me more!

Theyre called ""For each"" loops

They work like this:

    cake = 0
    for x in ingredients:
        cake += x

Wait that's it? what's happening here??

""for X in Y:"" is the syntax of a loop

It reads as: for each value in Y, temporarily store the value in X

Notice then the "":"" and indented code. Like functions, for loops have their own scope, their own code

The lines of code in a for loop will run again for every value in the list 

There are 4 values in ingredients, so ""cake += x"" runs 4 times, with a new X each time

One last thing, what is ""+=""?

Simply put, it adds a new number to the current number

    X = 1
    X += 2

X now hold the value 3

Got it? Great now let's put this cake together!

Let's combine: functions, lists, and for loops

    egg = 1
    butter = 2
    flour = 3
    milk = 4
    ingredients = [egg, butter, flour, milk]

    def bake(data):
        recipe = 0
        for x in data:
            recipe += x
        return recipe

    cake = bake(ingredients)
    print(cake)

And that's barely scratching the surface!

There are dictionaries, classes, objects, and so much more!

But all this talk of cake is making me hungry, so I'll pause there to grab a snack and give you some time to try and make a cake of your own 🎂",17,"I’m 14 and am currently taking programming lessons.

How would a specific tool or package be the most useful thing for “general programming?”

Specific tools and packages are used to solve…. Specific problems.

What makes a general purpose programming language “general” is that it can do anything, or put another way everything. Once you have that general property, the things are specific to solving specific problems.

Without modifying its source code you could define a temporary local method with an inconsequential name (something like `_data_iter`) and dynamically assign it to `data.__iter__ = _data_iter`.

Now, this is obviously not clean code. It breaks static type checkers. It's hard to keep track of which data objects you've made iterable and which you haven't. Though I think it's a good band aid solution for the bad situation you're already in.

An object that implements the `__iter__` method to return a iterator is *iterable* in the Pythonic sense.

1. You don't need to put`ez_` infront of everything, your package's namesapce is enough.  
2. Your try/except in your __init__ is unnecessary, and probably a workaround for proper package pathing.
3. A lot of your functionality is builtin to python, such as from `itertools` or `pathlib.Path`. For example, reading all the text from a file? `Path(""my_file.txt"").read_text()`. Recursively searching for all text files? `Path(""my_dir/"").rglob(""*.txt"")`. Why does `is_alphabet` exist? it just calls `my_str.isalpha()`, so not really any easier?
5. Your file contents are sort of all over the place.

I have several large-ish web-apps deployed currently and they're all running Pyramid, so no ASGI. Right now, I'm torn between Starlite and Sanic.

Python,RKHS,"A set of shit tier packages that you're unlikely to be using.

* Ascii2text. The code was responsible for downloading and executing a malicious script that searches for local passwords and loads them using a discord web hook.
* Pyg-utils, Pymocks, and PyProto2. As part of the setup.py installation, Pyg-utils is associated with a malicious domain (pygrata.com) which may be the infrastructure of a phishing attack. Interestingly, Pymocks and PyProto2 have nearly identical code targeting a different domain – pymocks.com.
* asynchronous test. It’s described in its description as “a very cool and very useful test package that everyone 100% needs”. In its setup.py installer, it downloads and executes most likely malicious code from the web. Interestingly, before this snippet is downloaded, it notifies the Discord channel of a “new playback” start.
* Free-net-vpn and Free-net-vpn2 They are malicious packages that target environment variables. These secrets are then propagated to a specific site by the dynamic DNS mapping service.
* zips, Probably to try to confuse PyPI users with the popular Python package included with zlib.
* Browsersteals the installer’s credentials and sends them to a web link on Discord as part of the installation process.

Python,ThePiGuy0,"Had a skim through the script and generally speaking the code is good! However, I do have a few comments

* Try to keep your naming consistent. For the most part, you've used PEP8-style snake case (e.g. ""my\_method\_name"") but there's at least one instance of camel case (""myMethodName"") which is unconventional for Python.
* On a similar note, generally using underscores in variables signals to linters that you expect them to be unused. Instead, I'd perhaps try to find a more unique name (e.g. in your manager method, what actually is \_range? Reading your code I can see this is the number of threads you want to use - perhaps call it ""number\_of\_threads"" or similar, something that indicates what it actually is).
* Global variables (e.g. those defined outside any functions or classes) can be referred to within any method - the ""global"" keyword is only required if you are editing them. Though generally if you need the global keyword, you should check whether you can do it by passing and returning values instead as this is better practice.
* Very minor thing - When inheriting from a base class, Python 3 allows you to run the \_\_init\_\_ method with the super keyword (e.g. ""super().\_\_init\_\_()""). Generally I'd say this is less error prone as it means if you change the class it inherits from, that statement automatically switches.
* Final comment, generally you should try to avoid defining methods within other methods (e.g. you define extract\_ipv6 within main). Presumably you did this because it uses the socket variable. Instead, it should be defined outside main and have socket passed in as a parameter.

Sorry this is so long, thought I'd mention everything I noticed!

Edit: One more thing, there are a few cases of continues that don't need to be there. For example, line 92 - If we remove that else statement and the continue within, will the program behaviour change?",19,Network scanner

I use it to install game servers but I don’t see why it couldn’t also be used to put games on windows.  Steam has a db of their gameIDs publicly available.  Non server style games are available as well.

Then you wouldn’t have to add the screen size disclaimer.  Could even let someone browse a game list to try and install by looking up the ID in the DB.

Typically controlling mouse movements isn’t a great idea.  You’ll run into problems where a window may not be in the exact position every time, the UI could change, or you could get a pop up mid script and accidentally click something else.
